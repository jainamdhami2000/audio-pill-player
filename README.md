# Audio Pill Player

## Overview

Audio Pill Player is an innovative web application designed to emulate the functionalities of an audio editing tool, similar to iMovie but focused solely on audio. This project allows users to create, upload, and manipulate multiple audio tracks on a dynamic timeline, providing a seamless and interactive experience for audio editing directly in the browser.

The application is built using React, leveraging its powerful state management and component-based architecture to offer real-time feedback and manipulation of audio elements. This project is ideal for podcast editors, music producers, or anyone looking to mix and edit audio tracks without the need for complex software installations.

## Features

- **Audio Track Upload:** Users can upload multiple audio files, which are then represented as "audio pills" on the timeline.
- **Dynamic Timeline:** The timeline allows for the intuitive placement, rearranging, and adjustment of audio tracks.
- **Playback Control:** Integrated playback controls enable users to play, pause, and scrub through the audio timeline to review edits.
- **Track Manipulation:** Users can easily shift audio tracks along the timeline, adjust their length, and organize their sequence for playback.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes made to the audio timeline are reflected in real-time during playback, offering immediate feedback on edits.
